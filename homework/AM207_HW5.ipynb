    "## Problem 1: Monte Carlo and Simulation Revisited\n",
    "In Homework #2, we used simulation to compute the expected values of functions of random variables. That is, given a random variable $X$, defined over $\\mathbb{R}$, distributed according to the pdf $f_X$, and given a real-valued function of $X$, $h(X)$, we approximated $\\mathbb{E}[h(X)]$ as follows\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[h(X)] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} h(x)f_X(x) dx \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N h(X_i), \\quad X_i \\sim f_X\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that, instead of being given the distribution $f_X$ and $h(X)$, you were simply asked to evaluate the following complex integral:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^4\\, \\sin\\left(\\sqrt{\\ln{(x+1)}}\\right)e^{-x}}{2+(x-4)^2} \\, dx \n",
    "$$\n",
    "A clever way to apply our Monte Carlo techniques would be to split the integrand as $h(x)f_X(x)$, and then approximate the integral as we have done in Homework #2:\n",

    "I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(x)\\,f_X(x) dx  \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N} h(X_i)$$ \n",

    "Rewrite your integrand as a product of two functions, $h(x)g(x)$, which can then be expressed as $h(x)f_X(x)$, where $f_X$ is a pdf (you may use one of the splits we propose in Part B or create your own). Explain why your choice of $h$ is appropriate. Explain why your choice of $g$ is appropriate for creating a pdf $f_X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Hint:** think about what you would have to do do turn $g$ into a good pdf and $h$ into a function that can be evaluated at multiple samples from this pdf. Think about how to choose these two functions to make your Monte Carlo approximation of $I$ as accurate as possible.)\n",

    "Suppose we ask you to memorize the order of the top five movies on IMDB. When we quiz you on the order afterwards, you might not recall the correct order, but the mistakes you will tend to make in your recall can be modeled by simple probabilistic models.\n",
